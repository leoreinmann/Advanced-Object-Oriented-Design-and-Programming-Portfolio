## Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming Portfolio
### Course Overview
This repository showcases my projects from the Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming course (CS635, Fall 2023) at SDSU. 
This course emphasized advanced object-oriented programming concepts, design patterns, software quality, and effective coding techniques.

### Projects 
#### Project 1: Trie Implementation Using Linked Structure
- Description: Implemented a trie data structure for efficient word storage and manipulation.
- Key Features:
  - Linked structure for data storage.
  - Add and find word functionality.
  - Special method to find words containing "ar".
  - Print all stored words.
- Skills Developed: Java programming, data structure implementation, object-oriented design.

#### Project 2: Binary Search Tree with Strategy and Visitor Pattern 
- Description: Created a binary search tree (BST) for managing Student objects with custom sorting.
- Key Features:
  - BST storing Student objects with attributes like name, ID, and GPA.
  - Internal iterator with lambda functions.
  - Strategy pattern for sorting: by ID, by name, and by GPA.
  - Null Object pattern for eliminating checks for null references or pointers in the tree
  - Visitor pattern for counting null nodes and the computing the longest path
- Skills Developed: Strategy pattern, lambda expressions, advanced data structures, Java programming.

#### Project 3: Mini Turtle Language Interpreter
- Description: Developed an interpreter for a mini turtle language inspired by Etoys and Scratch.
- Key Features:
  - Turtle class simulating movement on a 2D plane.
  - Mini language with commands for movement, turning, looping, and variable management.
  - Interpreter design pattern for executing turtle programs.
- Skills Developed: Interpreter pattern, language design, Java programming, abstract syntax tree representation.

### Key Concepts
- Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Observer, Strategy, etc.
- Refactoring: Code improvement techniques.
- Coupling and Cohesion: Impact on software quality.
- Unit Testing: Ensuring code reliability.
